# Stellar SDK for Scala

This is the SDK for performing [Stellar](https://www.stellar.org/) operations via Scala. It provides the ability to
access the Stellar network via Horizon instances to build and submit transactions, query the state of the network and
stream updates.

Scala developers may prefer to use this SDK because it provides a more natural API for Scala developers than the
official Java SDK

The code throughout this documentation is compiled against Scala $scalaBinaryVersion$.


## Quick-start

Add the jitpack resolver.

`resolvers += "jitpack" at "https://jitpack.io"`

Then, add the SDK via your dependency management tool.

@@dependency[sbt,Maven,Gradle] {
  group="$organization$"
  artifact="$name$_2.13"
  version="$version$"
}

Creating an account on the public test network.

@@snip [FriendBotSpec.scala](../../it/scala/stellar/sdk/FriendBotSpec.scala) { #friendbot_example }

Fetching the details of an account.

@@snip [LocalNetworkIntegrationSpec.scala](../../it/scala/stellar/sdk/LocalNetworkIntegrationSpec.scala) { #account_details_example }

Submitting a payment.

@@snip [NetworkSpec.scala](../../it/scala/stellar/sdk/LocalNetworkIntegrationSpec.scala) { #payment_example }
